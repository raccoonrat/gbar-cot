## Explanation

This PoC implements the gradient-based attentional redirection mechanism for Chain-of-Thought intervention in a simplified transformer model. The implementation includes:

1. A simplified transformer model with attention mechanism
2. Calculation of Reasoning Influence Functions (RIF)
3. Second-order optimization for attention matrix adjustment
4. A Streamlit-based visualization interface to demonstrate the attention weight changes before and after optimization

The Streamlit interface allows users to input text, specify a target answer, and visualize how the attention weights change during the optimization process. This provides an intuitive demonstration of how gradient-based attentional redirection can be used to influence the reasoning process of a language model.

Note that this is a simplified implementation for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would use a pre-trained large language model and more sophisticated tokenization and processing pipelines.
